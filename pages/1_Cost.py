        - Alerts are created as `CREATE ALERT` objects in Snowflake
        - They run on a schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes, every hour)
        - When triggered, they can log to a table, call a procedure, or execute any SQL
        - Alerts use a **serverless compute** model (no warehouse needed)
        
        **Supported Triggers:**
        - Credit burn > threshold per hour
        - Failed query count > threshold
        - Queue time > threshold seconds
        - Warehouse running with no queries
